        <p>I'm 29 years old and work as an Account Manager and Sales Coordinator for a decoration tech company. I live in Irvington and have two sassy dogs named Baby and Kahlua. My dream job would be to be a famous Youtuber or write for TV shows. I love to randomly break out into song and in my free time, I play video games and mindlessly consume content from the internet.  </p>
